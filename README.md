# New York Times Movie Reviews
I am using developer apis from https://developer.nytimes.com/.

The app is fetching the top 20 reviews of the movies from the api and showing it on the list.Every list item is clickable which takes you to the detials page.

As part of the test given. Followning tasks are completed 
1. An element has at least a name and an image.
2. Each element must be clickable and open a screen where the image and its description are fully visible.
Feel free to add any information you think is valuable
3. The list must be able to be ordered by name alphabetically.
4. Elements must be filterable by name.
5. The application must be able to consume the information from a WebService. Note: the data may come
from mocks, but they must be consumed as if they were provided by a server. Developing a WebService
is valid, but not necessary.

6. Additionally,To view full stroy of a review there is a readmore... real eatate which takes you to chrome web.
